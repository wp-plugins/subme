SubMe provides a simple subscription management and email notification system for WordPress blogs that sends plain text email notifications to a list of subscribers when you publish a new post. SubMe allows you to send out badges of email by using the Wordpress cron functionality. Its purpose is to provide a simple notification system that works and is secure.
